The story of the natural exponential function and Euler's number dates back to the 17th century, when mathematicians
were trying to understand the properties of exponential functions.

In 1683, Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli discovered that the exponential function could be expressed as an infinite
series of terms that get smaller and smaller as the index of the term gets larger. This series is known as the Taylor
series expansion of the exponential function, and it is given by:

`e^x = 1 + x/1! + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...`

where x is the input variable, and n! is the factorial of n (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to n).

Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician who lived in the 18th century, was the first to realize the significance of this
infinite series expansion. He observed that when x is set to 1 in the Taylor series expansion of e^x, the series
converges to a particular number that he called "e". Euler proved that this number is a transcendental number, which
means that it cannot be expressed as the root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients.

The value of Euler's number is approximately `2.71828...` (to several decimal places), and it has many important
properties in mathematics and science. The natural exponential function, which is defined as e^x, is used to model
phenomena that involve exponential growth or decay, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and the charging or
discharging of a capacitor in an electrical circuit.

Today, Euler's number and the natural exponential function are fundamental concepts in calculus, differential equations,
and many other areas of mathematics and science.
